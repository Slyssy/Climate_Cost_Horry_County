          Horry County lies in the northeastern coastal region of South
          Carolina. The natural landscape is characterized by coastal, marsh,
          and forested ecosystems, Horry. Human activity has brought farming and
          paved surfaces to the landscape. Due to it's location Horry County's
          location on the Atlantic Coast, and and the presence of multiple
          watersheds fed by the Waccamaw, Lumber, and Little Pee Dee, and Great
          Pee Dee Rivers, Horry County has always been prone to flooding.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          However, in the past five years, residents of Horry County have begun
          to experience more severe flooding due to increasing frequency of
          hurricanes and heavy rainfall. Since 2016, Horry County has been
          directly hit by two major hurricanes, and impacted by severe winds and
          tropical storms from eight additional hurricanes.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The damaged caused by the increased rainfall can be seen in the money
          paid out by the federal government for storm recovery. The number and
          size of FEMA payouts over the years, which have far exceeded the
          growth in the population.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          On behalf of the flood survivor advocacy group, Horry County Rising,
          the Climate Cost Project survey the residents of Horry County to
          understand how their livelihood has been affected by flooding. The
          analysis relied on a household economic survey (n=127) of flood
          survivors, and follow-up phone interviews (n=15) of a subsample of
          households to validate results and obtain more context on survey
          response.

        The survey revealed significant financial harm to households, and found

        People who received FEMA assistance still ended up paying a median
        amount of $20,000 out of their financials to restore their houses to a
        livable condition.

        The barchart below shows a breakdown of reported out of pocket expenses

        reporting between $5,000 and $10,000 makes up the largest portion of
        those surveyed; however, those reporting between $10,000 and $30,000 and
        $50,000 in out of pocket expense make up a significant portion of those
        surveyed as well. These reported out of pocket expenses are substantial.

          What is a flood risk zone, and how is it different from a flood zone?
        </h3>
      </div>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Updated flood mapping needs to reflect the real risk of flooding. At
        present, the highest risk FEMA-designated flood zones are the V and A
        designated Special Hazard Flood Areas. These zones are supposed to
        indicate a one percent chance per year of flooding, with additional
        hazards implied in the V designated zones due to their coastal locations
        and susceptibility to wave action.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Houses and infrastructure that were designed to withstand flooding once
        every 100 years are now flooding more frequently. Housing and
        infrastructure development was generally avoided in flood zones where
        the chance of flooding was significantly greater than one percent per
        year. But the reality has changed so that much existing infrastructure
        and housing, as well as planned new developments, are now in high- risk
        zones for repeat flooding, for which there is no designation in FEMA’s
        Special Hazard Flood Maps.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The County’s ability to update its maps is limited by the lack of the
        descriptive power in FEMA’s current flood hazard rating system, which,
        with its implicit assumption of construction compliance for 100-year
        floods, does not capture real flood risk in extant and developing
        communities that are facing repeat flooding and climate change. This is
        a known problem with FEMA’s flood maps. Horry County is yet another
        example of a situation where the consequences of these problems are
        being felt in the deteriorating finances and security of its residents.
      </p>
      <div class="header">
        <h1>What can be done?</h1>
      </div>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The City of Horry County is currently in the process of setting up
        supplemental flood zones that will better understand and define flood
        risk.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Avoiding future construction in high risk areas will both help to make
        room for future residents of the county, and help leave more land to
        absorb flood waters.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Using the most up-to-date information about how flood zones will change
        in the future in order to make planning decisions can also help to keep
        people the county out of high water. The National Atmospheric and
        Oceanic Administration also has a different set of flood risk maps than
        FEMA. Incorporating this information into the county's flood maps can
        help to improve assessment of risk.
      </p>
      <div class="header">
        <h1>Making Room for Water</h1>
      </div>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Recent development in Horry County has been driven by population growth.
        The county's population has grown by 38.4% percent, from 270,274
        thousand people to 373,033 people. It is expected to grow by an
        additional 270,000 by 2040. For this reason, simply avoiding
        construction may not be viable strategy for the county. However, careful
        planning of infrastructure in new and existing buildings that
        accommodates for the water in the landscape can help with flood
        protection. You can see how Texas is changing its codes to account for
        water pollution and food waters.
