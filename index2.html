          <br /><br />Horry County lies in the northeastern coastal region of
          South Carolina. The natural landscape is characterized by coastal,
          marsh, and forested ecosystems, Horry. Human activity has brought
          farming and paved surfaces to the landscape. Due to it's location
          Horry County's location on <br /><br />

          The Atlantic Coast, and and the presence of multiple watersheds fed by
          the Waccamaw, Lumber, and Little Pee Dee, and Great Pee Dee Rivers,
          Horry County has always been prone to flooding. However, in the past
          five years, residents of Horry County have begun to experience more
          severe flooding due to increasing frequency of hurricanes and heavy
          rainfall. Since 2016, Horry County has been directly hit by two major
          hurricanes, and impacted by severe winds and tropical storms from
          eight additional hurricanes.<br /><br />
          The damaged caused by the increased rainfall can be seen in the money
          paid out by the federal government for storm recovery. The number and
          size of FEMA payouts over the years, which have far exceeded the
          growth in the population.<br /><br />
          On behalf of the flood survivor advocacy group, Horry County Rising,
          the Climate Cost Project survey the residents of Horry County to
          understand how their livelihood has been affected by flooding. The
          analysis relied on a household economic survey (n=127) of flood
          survivors, and follow-up phone interviews (n=15) of a subsample of
          households to validate results and obtain more context on survey
          response.

        The survey revealed significant financial harm to households, and found
        that having flood insurance or receiving financial aid did not protect
        houses from significant financial harm.

        The barchart below shows a breakdown of reported out of pocket expenses
        for the 103 residents surveyed. As you can see, the group of those
        reporting between $5,000 and $10,000 makes up the largest portion of
        those surveyed; however, those reporting between $10,000 and $30,000 and
        $50,000 in out of pocket expense make up a significant portion of those
        surveyed as well. These reported out of pocket expenses are substantial.

        Next we look at the reported household income reported by those

        to see that these out of pocket expenses can devistate families and ruin
        lives.
