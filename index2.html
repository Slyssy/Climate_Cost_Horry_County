          Horry County lies in the northeastern coastal region of South
          Carolina. The natural landscape is characterized by coastal, marsh,
          and forested ecosystems, Horry. Human activity has brought farming and
          paved surfaces to the landscape. Due to it's location Horry County's
          location on The Atlantic Coast, and and the presence of multiple
          watersheds fed by the Waccamaw, Lumber, and Little Pee Dee, and Great
          Pee Dee Rivers, Horry County has always been prone to flooding.

          However, in the past five years, residents of Horry County have begun
          to experience more severe flooding due to increasing frequency of
          hurricanes and heavy rainfall. Since 2016, Horry County has been
          directly hit by two major hurricanes, and impacted by severe winds and
          tropical storms from eight additional hurricanes.<br /><br />
          The damaged caused by the increased rainfall can be seen in the money
          paid out by the federal government for storm recovery. number on size
          of FEMA payouts over the years, which have far exceeded the growth in
          the population.<br /><br />
          On behalf of the flood survivor advocacy group, Horry County Rising,
          the Climate Cost Project survey the residents of Horry County to
          understand how their livelihood has been affected by flooding. The
          analysis relied on a household economic survey (n=127) of flood
          survivors, and follow-up phone interviews (n=15) of a subsample of
          households to validate results and obtain more context on survey
          response.

            protect houses from significant financial harm.
